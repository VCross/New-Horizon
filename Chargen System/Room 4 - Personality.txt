Filename: Room 3 - Personality
Date: April 2014
Programmer: Vincent Cross

Purpose:

One of the main rooms of the chargen process. Here the player needs to enter in a detailed personality section that outlines who their character is. There is only the one question.

- Tell us about your character's personality. What makes them who they are, their general mannerisms, their outlook on life in space, how they view other factions/races and all that juicy stuff. Also tell us why you feel that others would want to RP with your character in particular. (room4`personality) (R)
    
- Section status?  C - Complete, I - Incomplete, R - Revisions Required (room4`status)
    
Chargen Code: #1489
Generic Room Parent: #333
